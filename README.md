## üôã‚Äç Foreword
Thank you for dropping by! This is my first project which I used to learn React. While I have deployed the website, there is still much to do for me. From adding new features to discovering bugs, I might have made some slip-ups. Therefore, if I have coded in a sub-optimal manner, please send me a message and I will look into it.

I'm actively making updates to the code base, so stay tuned!

## :information_source: Project Rundown
This website was built using React and Material-UI and hosted on AWS S3 and Cloudfront.
